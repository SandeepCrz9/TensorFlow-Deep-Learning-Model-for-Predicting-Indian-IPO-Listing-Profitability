# TensorFlow-Deep-Learning-Model-for-Predicting-Indian-IPO-Listing-Profitability

# ðŸ“ˆ Predicting Profitability of Indian IPO Listings using TensorFlow

This project builds a **binary classification model** to predict whether an IPO in the Indian stock market will be **profitable on the listing day**. Leveraging historical IPO data and deep learning with TensorFlow, the model classifies IPOs as either **profitable (1)** or **not profitable (0)** based on financial and subscription-related features.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives

- Clean and preprocess a dataset of Indian IPOs
- Train a **binary classification model** using TensorFlow and Keras
- Predict IPO listing outcomes (gain vs. no gain)
- Evaluate model using accuracy and confusion matrix

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture

- Input: normalized numerical features
- Layers:
  - Dense layers with ReLU activation
  - Output layer with **sigmoid activation**
- Loss: `binary_crossentropy`
- Optimizer: `Adam`
